# Sloan Foundation Grants

This is for https://github.com/vipulnaik/donations

Specific issue: https://github.com/vipulnaik/donations/issues/44

The grants database is kinda dynamic, but if you give it the right parameters,
you can make it totally static and it will also give you all the grants at once:
